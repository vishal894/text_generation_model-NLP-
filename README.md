Different types of Recurrent Neural Networks.

    Image Classification
    Sequence output (e.g. image captioning takes an image and outputs a sentence of words).
    Sequence input (e.g. sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing positive or negative sentiment).
    Sequence input and sequence output (e.g. Machine Translation: an RNN reads a sentence in English and then outputs a sentence in French).
    Synced sequence input and output (e.g. video classification where we wish to label each frame of the video)
